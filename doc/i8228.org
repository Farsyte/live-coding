* i8228: System Controller and Bus Driver 8080A CPU

** Latch STATUS byte from CPU during SYNC

The 8228 lives to latch STATUS bits, using the /STSTB signal from the
8224 to clock the data in from the DATA bus.

Based on the data received, and gated by DBIN and WR_, it generates
the MEMR MEMW IOR IOW and INTA signals. HLDA going active will end
activation of the control signals.

The built-in self test of the module checks operation for each of
the ten possible status words from the 8080, testing a second time
when appropriate with HLDA terminating the cycle.

Note that the i8228 does not receive any of the clock signals, and
is driven purely by the edges on its input signals. When these signals
are later plotted against actual clocks and T-states, the ordering of
events will match the plots below, but the widths of various pulses
will be corrected.
