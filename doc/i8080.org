* i8080: Single Chip 8-bit Microprocessor

** Coming out of RESET

The initial condition for all simulation modules is the expected
initial power-on state, which for the 8080 means that RESET is high
and READY is low. We expect the startup cycle to be, first, releasing
the RESET signal, then raising READY.

This simulation currently does not allow for the environment to
prevent the memory chip from sending a rising edge on RDYIN. This
might be changed but only if it could be done without impacting
the performance during normal operation.

Note that we are executing from ROM, and the ROM simulation is set up
to set RDYIN low until it sees two /RD edges with the same address;
the last four T-states here are the first instruction in the next
plot.

** TODO Execute MOV instructions

Testing the MOV instructions will be much easier once we get a few other
instructions set up.

** Execute EI, DI, and HLT instructions
