* i8080: Single Chip 8-bit Microprocessor

** Coming out of RESET

The initial condition for all simulation modules is the expected
initial power-on state, which for the 8080 means that RESET is high
and READY is low. We expect the startup cycle to be, first, releasing
the RESET signal, then raising READY.

This simulation currently does not allow for the environment to
prevent the memory chip from sending a rising edge on RDYIN. This
might be changed but only if it could be done without impacting
the performance during normal operation.

Note that we are executing from ROM, and the ROM simulation is set up
to set RDYIN low until it sees two /RD edges with the same address;
the last four T-states here are the first instruction in the next
plot.

** Execute EI, DI, and NOP instructions

Execution continues from above, with one machine cycle overlap; the
evidence that the instructions are exeucting is seen in the INTE
signal at the bottom: EI, NOP, DI, and EI.

** Execute a HLT instruction

This plot includes the last T-state of the final EI instruction above,
then fetches and executes a HLT instruction, leading into a HALTACK
machine cycle, which issues a SYNC, but no DBIN, then simply locks
itself up into repeated "T_WH" sycles, until the next reset or
interrupt (and interrupts are not yet implemented).

** The whole thing (so far) in one plot

This plot shows the whole test run.
