* i8224: Clock Generator and Driver for 8080A CPU

** Generate Phi 1, Phi 2, and Status Strobe

Generally while running, the 8224 is responsible for generating
the two-phase clock for the 8080, and for issuing a Status Strobe
at a specific time when the CPU is asserting SYNC.

** Synchronize the RESET signal

The 8224 also provides synchronization of the RESET signal. In the hardware
this is an analog signal that starts at zero and is pulled upward against
a capacitor, and the chip uses a Schmitt trigger to turn it into an edge,
which is then sampled at a specific time in each T-state.

While the simulation does not model the analog aspect, it still has to
latch the value of the input at the correct time. The timing diagram
constrains the output edge timing based on the falling /STSTB edge and
the falling Φ₂ edge, in such a way that the only viable location for us
to do this is one OSC period after the rising Φ₂ edge.

The following plot shows the initial rise of /RESIN and consequently
the initial falling edge of RESET after power-on.

Note that this is in the context of Built-In Self-Test of the module,
the actual timing of SYNC from the 8080 will be different.

** Synchronize the READY signal

The 8224 also provides synchronization of the READY signal, with the
same timing as the READY signal above. The following plot shows the
initial rise of READY after power-up.

Note that this is in the context of Built-In Self-Test of the module,
the actual timing of SYNC from the 8080 will be different.
