GETSYS: read two tracks of diskette into memory starting at 2880H
actual operating system starts at 2900H

PUTSYS: write from 2880H to first two tracks of diskette

cold start is at 3E00H

CCP is at 2900H

2880H - two tracks of diskette loaded starting here
operating system starts here
2900H - CCP
3E00H - COLD

* diskette organization

track numbers are 00..76
sector numbers are 01..26
sectors are 128 bytes
-> multiplies out to 256256 bytes addresssable.
