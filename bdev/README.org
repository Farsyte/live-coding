* BDEV Mass Storage Area

This directory houses the files used to persist BDEV drive contents
from run to run, with one drive per file.

Data from the first sector of the first track is stored at the
beginning of the file, followed immediately by the data for the other
sectors on the track in ascending sector number; this is followed by
the second and following tracks in the same way.

The files may or may not be padded out so that their length is a
multiple of the host system page size.

If code accessing this data knows about the disk geometry (number of
bytes per sector, sectors per track, and tracks total) then all such
code needs to agree on these values via some external mechanism.
