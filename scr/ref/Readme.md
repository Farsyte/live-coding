# Reference Documents

These are intended to be as much of the text of my printed
reference documents as I am willing to hand-type and proof; I am
likely to leave out machine dependent items that I do not yet
need.

The symbol ... may appear where details have been elided.



## MODEL: fig-FORTH MODEL

The "MODEL.scr" was hand-entered from my printed copy of:

    fig-FORTH INSTALLATION MANUAL
    GLOSSARY MODEL EDITOR
    RELEASE 1 WITH COMPILER SECURITY AND VARIABLE LENGTH NAMES
    BY WILLIAM F. RAGSDALE
    November 1980

Much content has been elided. This file is intended to be used
in conjunction with the printed text (or a PDF of it).

Note that some bits are elided with "..." and must be
constructed for your target machine.

Note that some bits are marked IMPLDEP, review these when tuning
the code for your IMPL.
